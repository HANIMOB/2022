			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p align="justify">
				
				The study of animal and human movement has experienced a remarkable boom over the last decades, 
				mainly due to the availability of location-aware and biologging technologies that permit to constantly increase the amount of high spatio-temporal resolution data 
				for investigating movement patterns of individuals. 
				Such movements are typically analyzed with respect to a range of external environmental factors determining the observed patterns. 
				Among these, anthropogenic pressure plays a critical role in shaping animal movement and behavior. 
				Similarly, human movement behavior can largely be influenced by disruptive environmental events causing people to shift their mobility patterns, 
				which eventually may impact wildlife activity patterns in areas where wildlife intersects with human presence. 
				With some remarkable exceptions, understanding how dynamic human presence and activity shape animal behavior and movement remains a little-covered topic, 
				despite its potential functional ecological importance. 
				These efforts would benefit from bridging the gap between human mobility research and animal movement ecology, 
				and to integrate the two disciplines, e.g., developing bespoke complex spatio-temporal methods for both data fusion and analysis that currently do not exist or 
				are very limited. 
				Solving this challenge is crucial for  understanding human and animal responses to environmental changes..
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>Call for Papers</h3>
			<p align="justify">
			
				In this context of reciprocal needs and search for solutions by ecologists, GIS scientists and spatial computing scientists, 
				in 2021 the HANIMOB workshop has been proposed for the first time, getting a good success. 
				The aim of the workshop was to bridge the existing gap between these three different research communities developing routes for an interdisciplinary effort 
				to develop methods, metrics and other solutions that will integrate analysis of dynamic anthropogenic activity, 
				such as human mobility, into the study of animal movement. 
				We now call for a second edition of this workshop, building on the first one, keeping our focus on wildlife-human interaction, 
				but accepting contributions on a broader scale, that is, on any topics that bridge the interdisciplinary gap between animal movement and human mobility.<br>
				
				We will solicit submissions from researchers which describe new research ideas that focus on converging movement ecology and human mobility research, 
				as well as those that cover broader themes on either animal movement or human mobility.
				
				
			</p>
			<h3>Topics</h3>
			<p align="justify">
			<ul>	
				<li>Cross-scale analysis and integration  of human mobility data for analysis of wildlife-human interaction</li>
				<li>Integration of human mobility concepts and methods in movement ecology</li>
				<li>Integration of ecological concepts and methods in human mobility analysis</li>
				<li>Methods for fusion of movement data and contextual data (environmental, remote sensing, etc.)</li>
				<li>Context-aware movement analysis (analyzing integrated movement and contextual data)</li>
				<li>Predictive modeling and simulation of movement across the human and animal divide</li>	
				<li>Use cases in human mobility and/or animal movement analysis</li>
				<li>Software platforms for animal and/or human movement</li>
				<li>Data science and movement analytics approaches to movement ecology or human mobility</li>
				<li>Visualization and visual analytics for animal and/or human movement</li>
				<li>Geoprivacy issues in both human mobility and animal ecology (for example, approaches for movement data anonymization to prevent identification of individual humans or prevent poachers have access to locations of protected species)</li>
				<li>Ethics of movement data analysis, open data and open methods</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Workshop mode</h3>
			<p align="justify">
				We are currently not able to confirm the workshop mode (in person only or hybrid). 
				We will provide more information as soon as we find out more.
