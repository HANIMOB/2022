			<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

				Animal movement and behavior are altered by human activity and presence. 
				Ecologists have so far mainly focused on understanding the impact of anthropogenic activity on animal movement 
				(e.g. habitat loss and fragmentation, land use modification, etc. )
				which is typically done using static data from remote sensing and similar sources
				(e.g. road maps, high resolution forest cover, etc.). 
				However, understanding how dynamic human presence and activity 
				(e.g. road traffic or human recreational activities) affect animal behavior and movement remains a topic that so far received less attention, 
				despite its potential functional ecological importance. 
				One of the reasons for this may be the difficulty to obtain dynamic human data to combine with movement data from wildlife, 
				something which has only recently changed, 
				as human mobility products have been made  widely available during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
				This however requires bespoke complex spatio-temporal methods for both data fusion and analysis that currently do not exist. 
				Solving this challenge is crucial for movement ecology investigation, 
				as for example to unveil the effect of COVID-19 human lockdowns on animal movement and behavior. 
				This ambitious goal is being addressed by the COVID-19 Bio-Logging Initiative, where an interdisciplinary team of researchers, 
				supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the National Geographic Society is analysing bio-logging data 
				to explore the responsiveness of animals to the alteration of human pressure due to the pandemic. 
				In this context of reciprocal needs and search for solutions by ecologists, GIS scientists and spatial computing scientists,
				the HANIMOB workshop’s main focus is therefore an interdisciplinary effort to develop methods, metrics and other solutions 
				that will integrate analysis of dynamic anthropogenic activity, such as human mobility, into the study of animal movement. <br>
				While we focus on a specific topic, wildlife-human interaction, we are also interested in contributions on a broader scale, 
				that is, on any topics that bridge the interdisciplinary gap between animal movement and human mobility. <br>
				We invite submissions which describe new research ideas that focus on converging movement ecology and human mobility research, 
				as well as those that cover broader themes on either animal movement or human mobility.
			</p>
			<h3>Topics</h3>
			<p align="justify">
			<ul>	
				<li>Availability and downscaling of human mobility data for analysis of wildlife-human interaction</li>
				<li>Integration of human mobility concepts in movement ecology</li>
				<li>Integration of ecological concepts in human mobility analysis</li>
				<li>Methods for data fusion of movement data and contextual data (environmental, remote sensing, etc.)</li>
				<li>Context-aware movement analysis (analyzing integrated movement and contextual data)</li>
				<li>Use cases in human mobility and/or animal movement analysis</li>
				<li>Software platforms for animal and/or human movement</li>
				<li>Data science and movement analytics approaches to movement ecology or human mobility</li>
				<li>Visualisation and visual analytics for animal and/or human movement</li>
				<li>Geoprivacy issues in both human mobility and animal ecology (for example, approaches for movement data anonymisation to prevent identification of individual humans or prevent poachers have access to locations of protected species)</li>
				<li>Ethics of movement data analysis, open data and open methods</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Workshop mode</h3>
			<p align="justify">
				We are currently not able to confirm the workshop mode (online/hybrid/in person), 
				as this depends on the mode of the ACM SIGSPATIAL 2021 conference. 
				The SIGSPATIAL 2021 organisers have however confirmed that it will be possible to participate virtually, 
				even if the conference is held in person. We will provide more information as soon as we find out more.
				Please follow updates on the conference website: <a href="https://sigspatial2021.sigspatial.org" target="new">
